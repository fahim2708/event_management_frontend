      <h1>What is an About Us page?</h1>
       An About Us page is a section on a website that
      provides information about a company, organization, or individual. It’s an
      opportunity to tell your brand’s story, share your vision or mission,
      introduce team members, and outline your history and achievements. This is
      where you build trust and credibility with customers. In Shopify’s
      customer trust research, we found shoppers navigate to an About Us page to
      learn more about the brand and the people behind the products. Your About
      Page should address those two curiosities shoppers have to help them with
      decision making. Shoppers are also interested in a company’s mission and
      brand values. They’ll use the About Us page to determine if they share
      core values with the business and to decide if they want to shop with you
      or not. Shared values, especially related to ethical and sustainable
      business practices, continue to drive consumer decision making. Components
      of an About Us page In contrast to a landing page, your About Us page
      should focus more on your brand identity and less on sales. Here are some
      components to include in an About Us page: Your brand story Tell shoppers
      the origin story of your business and why you started it. For the most
      impact, make it memorable and personal, so customers relate and connect
      with your brand. If your brand is your name or it was formed based on a
      personal brand, your company’s story can be one and the same with your
      founder story. Who you serve What do you offer and who is it for? Help
      shoppers see the value of your product or service by sharing how it solves
      problems or meets different needs. This is known as your unique selling
      proposition. How you operate If you offer a service, explain your business
      model or how your products are made. If you have a unique way of doing
      things, show it. This builds credibility with shoppers and helps you stand
      out against competitors. The face of your business Feature photos of the
      founders or key people on your team. Customers like to see who they are
      buying from or working with. This can also include behind-the-scenes shots
      of your work space, studio, or retail store. Persuasive content Consider
      what step you’d like readers to take next. Use additional content and
      calls to action (CTAs) to move them forward towards that goal. This could
      include buttons, testimonials, an explainer video, data visualizations,
      links to blog posts, products, your social media accounts or newsletter.
      Your About Us page is going to be about you, but that doesn’t mean you
      can’t borrow some ideas from others, especially when it comes to structure
      and design. Reference:
